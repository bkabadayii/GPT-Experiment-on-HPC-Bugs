The code has the following performance bugs:

1. The constant variables `true` and `false` are defined with the same names as the boolean values in C, which can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

2. The `Busy` function is called with a fixed delay of 100 microseconds, which can cause unnecessary waiting and slow down the program. A better approach would be to use a dynamic delay that depends on the system load and other factors.

3. The `local_await` function uses a busy-wait loop to wait for a condition to be true, which can consume a lot of CPU resources and slow down the program. A better approach would be to use a blocking wait that allows the CPU to be used by other processes.

4. The `async_send` function uses a fixed buffer size of `SHMEM_BUF_SIZE`, which may not be optimal for all message sizes. A better approach would be to use a dynamic buffer size that depends on the message size.

To fix these bugs, we can define the boolean constants with different names, replace the `Busy` function with a more efficient waiting mechanism, replace the busy-wait loop in `local_await` with a blocking wait, and use a dynamic buffer size in `async_send`. Here is the fixed code:
