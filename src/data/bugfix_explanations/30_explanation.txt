The performance bug in the code is that the `validate_precision_reduction_feasibility` function is called for every block in the matrix, which is inefficient. This function is used to determine the optimal precision reduction for each block. However, this can be done more efficiently by computing the condition number of each block and using it to determine the optimal precision reduction for all blocks at once.

Here is the fixed code:
