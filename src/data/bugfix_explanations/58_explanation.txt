The performance bug in this code is that it is allocating and deallocating memory inside the sort() function, which is called repeatedly. This can cause a significant slowdown due to the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation. To fix this, we can move the memory allocation and deallocation to the constructor and destructor, respectively.

Here is the fixed code:

namespace OpenMM {

/**
 * This class sorts arrays of values.  It supports any type of values, not just scalars,
 * so long as an appropriate sorting key can be defined by which to sort them.
 * 
 * The sorting behavior is specified by a "trait" class that defines the type of data to
 * sort and the key for sorting it.  Here is an example of a trait class for
 * sorting floats:
 * 
 * class FloatTrait : public OpenCLSort::SortTrait {
 *     int getDataSize() const {return 4;}
 *     int getKeySize() const {return 4;}
 *     const char* getDataType() const {return "float";}
 *     const char* getKeyType() const {return "float";}
 *     const char* getMinKey() const {return "-MAXFLOAT";}
 *     const char* getMaxKey() const {return "MAXFLOAT";}
 *     const char* getMaxValue() const {return "MAXFLOAT";}
 *     const char* getSortKey() const {return "value";}
 * };
 *
 * The algorithm used is a bucket sort, followed by a bitonic sort within each bucket
 * (in local memory when possible, in global memory otherwise).  This is similar to
 * the algorithm described in
 *
 * Shifu Chen, Jing Qin, Yongming Xie, Junping Zhao, and Pheng-Ann Heng.  "An Efficient
 * Sorting Algorithm with CUDA"  Journal of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, 32(7),
 * pp. 915-921 (2009)
 *
 * but with many modifications and simplifications.  In particular, this algorithm
 * involves much less communication between host and device, which is critical to get
 * good performance with the array sizes we typically work with (10,000 to 100,000
 * elements).
