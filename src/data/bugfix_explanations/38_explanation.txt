The performance bug in the code is that it does not use vectorization to speed up the computation. Specifically, the function `dasum_kernel_16` can be vectorized to process multiple elements at once, but it is currently implemented using scalar operations.

To fix the bug, we can replace the scalar operations in `dasum_kernel_16` with vector operations using SIMD instructions. Here is the fixed code:
