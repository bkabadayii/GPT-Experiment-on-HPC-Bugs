One performance bug in this code is that the function gmx_mtop_atomnr_to_atom() performs a linear search through the entire atom array to find the atom with the given global index. This can be very slow for large systems. To fix this, we can add an array to the gmx_mtop_t struct that maps global atom indices to their position in the atom array. This array can be generated in the gmx_mtop_finalize() function.

Here is the full fixed code:
