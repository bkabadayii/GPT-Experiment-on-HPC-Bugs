The performance bugs in the code are caused by unnecessary parallelization using OpenMP. Specifically, the `spmv2` and `advanced_spmv2` functions parallelize over the columns of the dense matrix `b`, which is unnecessary since the loop over the columns is already vectorized by default. This leads to unnecessary overhead and can actually slow down the code.

To fix this, we can remove the OpenMP parallelization in these functions and keep the vectorization. The fixed code is shown below:
